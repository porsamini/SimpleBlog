1,Survival of the fittest,"Now lets go back to the stage millions and millions of years backwards(almost to life’s beginning). And you are existing too. And you are very hungry. And you know you should be eating something soon. All you are aware of is that you are lying on the forest floor and craving for food. And you can hardly see anything since you hardly have any energy to even visualize something. So, next:

   1. You grab something nearby you and start eating. After a while you feel better and now you can see things. Now you see there are some green leaves in your hand that you just ate and you name it “spinach” leaves.
   2. You grab something nearby you and start eating. After a while you feel better and now you can see things. Now you see small pieces of tree barks in your hand. It tasted yuck. Now you know you shouldn’t be eating this again.
   3. You grab something nearby you and start eating. After a while you feel better and now you can see things. And then you come to know its blood around you, all over your body! You just ate rat meat.

The first point seemed alright. Second point seemed nasty. The third point seems “okay” to the non-veggies. But the veggies will seem skeptical about this, perhaps. But the first case and the third case is now termed as “food” in general. As life evolves and you become more organized and you start classifying every single thing around you(including yourself and of your kind). One of them you shall call yourself :

   1. Something like “Veggie” -> the one who eats only plants and their sub parts (lets name this class of people as V).
   2. Or something like “Flesh Eater” -> the one who eats only flesh and drinks blood for survival (lets name this class of people as F)

Life evovles more and you are still confined to same eating habits. But now you come across few changes:

   1. V sees F eating something which is not green. And asks F to share his food with V. He indeed likes the change (we shall now name this class of people as O).
   2. F sees V eating something which is not red. And asks V to share his food with F. He likes the change too (we shall name this class of people as O too. Since O now considers both green and red as food)
   3. F sees V eating something which is not red, but is not comfortable with the change he sees. F says to V, “gees, why is that you eat?” (name this guy as C)
   4. V sees F eating something which is not green, but is not comfortable with the change he sees. V says to F, “ewww, why is that you eat?” (name this guy as H)

Life evolves and becomes more organized and you observe what other creatures eat. They are either alike you or disjoint. So the green eating creatures are termed as Herbivorous. Flesh eating creatures are termed as Carnivorous. Those eating both is now termed as Omnivorous.

So this is where all the eating habits started. And it has also slowly evolved to spiritual levels and they are sub-divided to something called as “caste” and “relegion”.

All the three class of human still exist and they still stick to their eating habits. Skeptical about the class C in human? YES they do exist in some parts of Africa!!

Do respect all the three class of existance and not make nasty faces when you see the other being different from your eating habits. Indeed both plants and meat is termed as FOOD. So at one level, both make no difference.

I’d like to pose an important question here:

You are lost in an island. And you have a blown off raft. For water, you’ve to depend on the rain. And there is no food source around you, except for the fishes in the water. But no plants around you. For the survival of the fittest, You have to make the decision between life and death. What would you do now?",1
2,"Channelling Dennis,Forty summers ago in Adelaide, a gusty wind flapping from the south, Dennis Lillee took the new ball for Australia. From that day on he never willingly let it go. Occasionally a captain tried prising the new ball off him. That made Dennis cross enough to bite the ears off a kitten. The first time it happened, in 1975–76, Dennis was doing his warm-ups when Greg Chappell tossed the ball to Gary Gilmour instead. This insult to his manliness brought out the little boy in Dennis. With a pout on his lips and lead in his shoes, he ambled in first change and served up half an hour’s crap on a platter – only to realise, after a word from his mate Bacchus Marsh, that in doing so he was proving the skipper right all along.

When it happened again eight summers later he took the opposite approach – and again proved his captain correct. Fine, huffed Dennis, if bloody Kim Hughes preferred Geoff Lawson, Rod Hogg and Carl Rackemann to him, then he, Dennis, would bowl so super-amazingly as to put a couple of extra z’s in amazing. The result, he confessed, was “the biggest load of rubbish ever seen at the Gabba… I bowled with stupid emotion instead of my head”.

Today at the Gabba it took about 10 minutes to suspect that England’s opening batsmen were not for unsticking. So we sat and waited for Mitchell Johnson to be given the ball. Johnson – in theory, and in talent – is Australia’s match-winner. So we sat. And we waited. Dennis, upon being denied the new cherry, was furious about not being warned in advance and even furiouser that, well, that it had happened at all. No noticeable fury simmered in Johnson during his long wait today. No fire came out of his left arm once the wait was over.

Johnson’s attitude went more like this: he was oh so polite and whatever-you-think-Ricky about it all. That same gentle deference was extended to the batsmen. He began from the Stanley Street End with a bouncer at Andrew Strauss’s head and seemed thereafter reluctant to veer near the batsmen’s toes. Full balls were not full enough to hurry anyone. Short balls were not short enough to unnerve anyone. Only half the time was anyone required to produce an actual stroke. And seldom were three consecutive deliveries alike. Johnson’s fifth over was typical: one straight, one wide of leg, another very wide of off, two straight, one a foot outside off. If this was over-thinking things, it was just as much a case of under-thinking. Had Johnson not succeeded the great Glenn McGrath as Australia’s enforcer? Why not give the McGrath way a try?

Perhaps the best ball of his opening spell was the 36th and last one. Slung from around the wicket, it pitched on middle and had a hint of away-wobble, and it made Alastair Cook wince. He was dragged the very next over and consigned to mid-off, where Strauss promptly sent a high catch floating his way. Johnson stuttered towards it; he jumped at, juggled and dropped it. It was, perhaps, a little window into his mind – a mind not furious like Dennis’, but not exactly cloudless either.

Lunch came and went with England still no wicket down, and we sat and we waited, through four different bowlers and an hour and a half of nothing much happening, for Johnson to be handed the ball again. Then everyone went off for tea, and the new ball was due, and we sat and we… Well, the pattern of this day we knew now by heart.

When Johnson did come back, one last time, you still thought him as likely as anyone to take a wicket. You thought, too, that here is a bowler in need of a month or two’s Sheffield Shield cricket, and the freedoms that brings: to try an over of yorkers, an over of bouncers, an over where five balls don’t do a lot but are all the same. To run in and bowl fast and not think. A little less politeness, a little more of what a wise and grumpy man would call “stupid emotion”, might help too,",2\
3,Swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan,"Switzerland has approved a plan to automatically deport foreigners convicted of serious crimes. The proposal, put forth by the nationalist Swiss People’s Party, has been criticized by human rights groups.

Swiss voters have approved a far-right initiative to automatically expel foreign residents convicted of serious crimes, according to poll results.

Swiss national broadcaster SF1 said 52.9 percent of voters backed the initiative in Sunday’s referendum, a plan proposed by the nationalist Swiss People’s Party (SVP).

A counter-proposal put forth by the Swiss government, which would make expulsion dependent on the length of a prison term rather on an arbitrary list of offenses, appears to have been rejected by most voters, according to preliminary results. Currently, decisions to expel foreigners convicted of serious crimes are made on a case-by-case basis.

The initiative, which would apply to foreigners convicted of crimes like murder, rape or trafficking in drugs or people, has been criticized by human rights groups and legal experts, who said it could disregard international anti-discrimination treaties and the free movement of peoples under European Union law.

Switzerland, while not an EU member, does allow EU citizens to take residence without special permission.

Foreigners make up more than a fifth of Switzerland’s population of 7.7 million, and according to official figures are disproportionately charged with crimes.

Growing support for SVP

The SVP has become one of Switzerland’s biggest political movements in recent years, garnering support by playing on the rising fear about immigration.

Posters for the SVP proposal showed a group of white sheep kicking a black sheep off the Swiss flag, a move criticized by anti-racism groups.

Sunday’s referendum comes a year after Switzerland approved a ban on the construction of minarets, a decision that drew international criticism.",2
